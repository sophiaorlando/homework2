\*This is a web page that is all of the work I've done in this bootcamp

- I used HTML and Bootstrap and CSS
- I manipulated

The Navbar is consistent on each page.
Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
All links work.
I use semantic html.
Each page has valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
This contains my personalized information.
This properly utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.
